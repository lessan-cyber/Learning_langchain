    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conponents ou modules are reusable elements that executer specific taks ,like data-entry , accessing external data , managing workflows and memory integration\n",
    "- Chains are sequences of conponents or modules that work together to complete a goal like summarise a doc, generate an article , or provide recommandations.\n",
